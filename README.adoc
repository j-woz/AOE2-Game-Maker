= AOE2 Game Maker

Goal: Propose reasonable games, including with AI opponents of various levels.

== Overview

* Each player has a rank, starting at 1.
* Rank goes up by 1 when you win.
* Rank goes down by 1 when you lose.
* Ranks may not go below 0.
* The various AI levels are included as A2, A3, A4.
* AI players are treated as humans for ranks.
* Games will be proposed by simply minimizing the rank difference
  between the per-team rank sum.
* Thus, the process will constantly be proposing and updating
  games based on the win/loss history.

== Practicals

* The history is stored in a Google Sheet:
* This is downloaded as CSV and run through a Python program.
* The program evaluates all possible combinations and reports the
  lowest rank difference.
* Any player can run the program and get the same result.

== Sample history

Consider players AA-GG.  Each player has a rank based on the win/loss
records shown in brackets and an instrinsic value known only to God (in parens).
